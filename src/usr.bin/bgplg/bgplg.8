.Sh NAME
.Nm bgplg
.Nd looking glass for the
.Ox
Border Gateway Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bgplg
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
CGI program is a looking glass for the
.Xr bgpd 8
Border Gateway Protocol daemon.
The looking glass will provide a simple web interface with read-only
access to a restricted set of
.Xr bgpd 8
and system status information, which is typically used on route
servers by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet eXchange
points (IXs).
It is intended to be used in a
.Xr chroot 2
environment in
.Pa /var/www .
.Pp
.Nm
is disabled by default.
It requires four steps to enable the looking glass:
.Bl -enum
.It
Update the file permission mode to allow the execution of the
.Nm
CGI program and the additional statically linked programs that have
been installed into the
.Xr chroot 2
environment.
See the
.Sx FILES
section below for the list of installed programs.
.Pp
For example,
to allow execution of
.Nm
and the statically-linked version of
.Xr bgpctl 8
(disabled commands like
.Xr ping 8
and
.Xr traceroute 8
will be hidden from looking glass command list):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chmod 0555 /var/www/cgi-bin/bgplg
# chmod 0555 /var/www/bin/bgpctl
.Ed
.It
The programs
.Xr ping 8
and
.Xr traceroute 8
will require a copy of the resolver configuration file
.Xr resolv.conf 5
in the
.Xr chroot 2
environment for optional host name lookups.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mkdir /var/www/etc
# cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/www/etc
.Ed
.It
Start the Border Gateway Protocol daemon with a second,
restricted, control socket that can be used
from within the
.Xr chroot 2
environment.
See
.Xr bgpd 8
for more information.
.Pp
For example,
set the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
to start
.Xr bgpd 8
using the second, restricted, control socket:
.Pp
.Dl bgpd_flags=\&"-r /var/www/logs/bgpd.rsock\&"
.Pp
.It
Start the Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server.
See
.Xr httpd 8
for more information.

.It Pa /var/www/logs/bgpd.rsock
Position of the second, restricted, control socket of
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.El
.Pp
The following statically linked executables have been installed into
the
.Xr chroot 2
environment of the
.Xr httpd 8
server.
To enable the corresponding functionality, use the
.Xr chmod 1
utility to manually set the file permission mode to 0555 or anything
appropriate.

.It Pa /var/www/cgi-bin/bgplg
The

.It Pa /var/www/bin/bgpctl
The
.Xr bgpctl 8
program used to query information from
.Xr bgpd 8
.It Pa /var/www/bin/ping
The
.Xr ping 8
program used to send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts.
Requires the set-user-ID bit, set the permission mode to 4555.
.It Pa /var/www/bin/traceroute
The
.Xr traceroute 8
program used to print the route packets take to network hosts.
Requires the set-user-ID bit, set the permission mode to 4555.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
The initial implementation was done in 2005 for DE-CIX, the German
commercial internet exchange point.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by
.An Reyk Floeter Aq reyk@vantronix.net .
.Sh CAVEATS
To prevent commands from running endlessly,
.Nm
will kill the corresponding processes after a hard limit of 60 seconds.
For example, this can take effect when using
.Xr traceroute 8
with blackholed or bad routes.
