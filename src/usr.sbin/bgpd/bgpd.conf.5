.Sh NAME
.Nm bgpd.conf
.Nd Border Gateway Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon implements the Border Gateway Protocol version 4 as described
in RFC 1771.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into four main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.It Sy Neighbors and Groups
.Xr bgpd 8
establishes sessions with
.Em neighbors .
The neighbor definition and properties are set in this section, as well as
grouping neighbors for the ease of configuration.
.It Sy Filter
Filter rules for incoming and outgoing
.Em UPDATES .
.El
.Pp
With the exception of macros,
the sections should be grouped and appear in
.Nm
in the order shown above.
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic AS ,
.Ic neighbor ,
or
.Ic group ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
peer1="1.2.3.4"
neighbor $peer1 {
	remote-as 65001
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
There are quite a few settings that affect the operation of the
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon globally.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic AS Ar as-number
Set the local
.Em autonomous system
number to
.Ar as-number .
The AS numbers are assigned by local RIRs, such as
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx -compact
.It RIPE
for Europe,
.It ARIN
for America, and
.It APNIC
for the Asian-Pacific region.
.El
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
AS 65001
.Ed
.Pp
sets the local AS to 65001.
.Pp
.It Ic dump table Ar file Op Ar timeout
.It Xo
.Ic dump
.Pq Ic all Ns \&| Ns Ic updates
.Pq Ic in Ns \&| Ns Ic out
.Ar file Op Ar timeout
.Xc
Dump the RIB, a.k.a. the
.Em routing information base ,
and all BGP messages in Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) format.
Dumping the RIB is normally an expensive operation,
but it should not influence the session handling.
Excessive dumping may result in delayed update processing.
.Pp
For example, the following will dump the entire table to the
.Xr strftime 3 Ns -expanded
filename.
The timeout is optional:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump table "/tmp/rib-dump-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
Similar to the table dump, but this time all
BGP messages and
.Em state transitions
will be dumped to the specified file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump all in "/tmp/all-in-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
As before, but only the
.Em UPDATE
messages will be dumped to the file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump updates in "/tmp/updates-in-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
It is also possible to dump outgoing messages:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump all out "/tmp/all-out-%H%M" 300
# or
dump updates out "/tmp/updates-out-%H%M" 300
.Ed
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Forward Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds
Set the holdtime in seconds.
The holdtime is reset to its initial value every time either a
.Em KEEPALIVE
or an
.Em UPDATE
message is received from the neighbor.
If the holdtime expires the session is dropped.
The default is 90 seconds.
Neighboring systems negotiate the holdtime used when the connection is
established in the
.Em OPEN
messages.
Each neighbor announces its configured holdtime; the smaller one is
then agreed upon.
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime min Ar seconds
The minimal accepted holdtime in seconds.
This value must be greater than or equal to 3.
.Pp
.It Ic listen on Ar address
Specify the local IP address
.Xr bgpd 8
should listen on.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 127.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic log updates
Log received and sent updates.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic network
.Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar prefix
.Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
Announce the specified network as belonging to our AS.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
network 192.168.7.0/24
.Ed
.Pp
It is possible to set default
.Em AS path attributes
per
.Ic network
statement:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
network 192.168.7.0/24 set localpref 220
.Ed
.Pp
See also the
.Sx ATTRIBUTE SET
section.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic route-collector
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
the route selection process is turned off.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID to the given IP address, which must be local to the
machine.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
router-id 10.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
If not given, the BGP ID is determined as the biggest IP address assigned
to the local machine.
.El
.Sh NEIGHBORS AND GROUPS
.Xr bgpd 8
establishes TCP connections to other BGP speakers called
.Em neighbors .
Each neighbor is specified by a
.Ic neighbor
section, which allows properties to be set specifially for that neighbor:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor 10.0.0.2 {
	remote-as 65002
	descr "a neighbor"
}
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple neighbors can be grouped together by a
.Ic group
section.
Each
.Ic neighbor
section within the
.Ic group
section inherits all properties from its group:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
group "peering AS65002" {
	remote-as 65002
	neighbor 10.0.0.2 {
		descr "AS65002-p1"
	}
	neighbor 10.0.0.3 {
		descr "AS65002-p2"
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
Instead of the neighbor's IP address, an address/netmask pair may be given:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
neighbor 10.0.0.0/8
.Ed
.Pp
In this case, the neighbor specification becomes a
.Em template ,
and if a neighbor connects from an IP address within the given network,
the template is
.Em cloned ,
inheriting everything from the template but the remote address, which is
replaced by the connecting neighbor's address.
With a template specification it is valid to omit
.Ic remote-as ;
.Xr bgpd 8
will then accept any AS the neighbor presents in the
.Em OPEN
message.
.Pp
There are several neighbor properties:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic announce
.Po Ic all Ns \&| Ns
.Ic none Ns \&| Ns Ic self Pc
.Xc
If set to
.Ic none ,
no
.Em UPDATE
messages will be sent to the neighbor.
If set to
.Ic all ,
all generated
.Em UPDATE
messages will be sent to the neighbor.
This is usually used for
.Em transit AS's
and
.Em IBGP
peers.
The default value
for
.Em EBGP
peers is
.Ic self ,
which limits the sent
.Em UPDATE
messages to announcements of the local AS.
The default for IBGP peers is
.Ic all .
.Pp
.It Ic descr Ar description
Add a description.
The description is used when logging neighbor events and in status
reports, etc., and has no further meaning to
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic dump
.Pq Ic all Ns \&| Ns Ic updates
.Pq Ic in Ns \&| Ns Ic out
.Ar file Op Ar timeout
.Xc
Do a peer specific MRT dump.
Peer specific dumps are limited to
.Ic all
and
.Ic updates .
See also the
.Ic dump
section in
.Sx GLOBAL CONFIGURATION .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic enforce neighbor-AS
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
.Em AS paths
whose
.Em leftmost AS
is not equal to the
.Em remote AS
of the neighbor are rejected and a
.Em NOTIFICATION
is sent back.
The default value for IBGP peers is
.Ic no
otherwise the default is
.Ic yes .
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds
Set the holdtime in seconds.
Inherited from the global configuration if not given.
.Pp
.It Ic holdtime min Ar seconds
Set the minimal acceptable holdtime.
Inherited from the global configuration if not given.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic ipsec
.Pq Ic ah Ns \&| Ns Ic esp
.Pq Ic in Ns \&| Ns Ic out
.Ic spi Ar spi-number authspec Op Ar encspec
.Xc
Enable IPsec with static keying.
There must be at least two
.Ic ipsec
statements per peer with manual keying, one per direction.
.Ar authspec
specifies the authentication algorithm and key.
It can be
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sha1 <key>
md5 <key>
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar encspec
specifies the encryption algorithm and key.
.Ic ah
does not support encryption.
With
.Ic esp ,
encryption is optional.
.Ar encspec
can be
.Bd -literal -offset indent
3des <key>
3des-cbc <key>
aes <key>
aes-128-cbc <key>
.Ed
.Pp
Keys must be given in hexadecimal format.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic ipsec
.Pq Ic ah Ns \&| Ns Ic esp
.Ic ike
.Xc
Enable IPsec with dynamic keying.
In this mode,
.Xr bgpd 8
sets up the flows, and a key management daemon such as
.Xr isakmpd 8
is responsible for managing the session keys.
With
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
it is sufficient to copy the peer's public key, found in
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/private/local.pub ,
to the local machine.
It must be stored in a file
named after the peer's IP address and must be stored in
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys/ipv4/ .
The local public key must be copied to the peer in the same way.
A simple
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.policy
file is needed as well; it can be as simple as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Authorizer: "POLICY"
Comment: This bare-bones assertion accepts everything
.Ed
.Pp
After starting the
.Xr isakmpd 8
and
.Xr bgpd 8
daemons on both sides, the session should be established.
.Pp
.It Ic local-address Ar address
When
.Xr bgpd 8
initiates the TCP connection to the neighbor system, it normally does not
bind to a specific IP address.
If a
.Ic local-address
is given,
.Xr bgpd 8
binds to this address first.
.Pp
.It Ic max-prefix Ar number
Limit the amount of prefixes received.
No such limit is imposed by default.
.Pp
.It Ic multihop Ar hops
Neighbors not in the same AS as the local
.Xr bgpd 8
normally have to be directly connected to the local machine.
If this is not the case, the
.Ic multihop
statement defines the maximum hops the neighbor may be away.
.Pp
.It Ic passive
Do not attempt to actively open a TCP connection to the neighbor system.
.Pp
.It Ic remote-as Ar as-number
Set the AS number of the remote system.
.Pp
.It Ic route-reflector Op Ar address
Act as an RFC 2796
.Em route-reflector
for this neighbor.
An optional cluster ID can be specified; otherwise the BGP ID will be used.
.Pp
.It Ic set Ar attribute ...
Set the
.Em AS path attributes
to some default per
.Ic neighbor
or
.Ic group
block:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set localpref 300
.Ed
.Pp
See also the
.Sx ATTRIBUTE SET
section.
.Pp
.It Ic tcp md5sig password Ar secret
.It Ic tcp md5sig key Ar secret
Enable TCP MD5 signatures per RFC 2385.
The shared secret can either be given as a password or hexadecimal key.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tcp md5sig password mekmidasdigoat
tcp md5sig key deadbeef
.Ed
.El
.Sh FILTER
.Xr bgpd 8
has the ability to
.Ic allow
and
.Ic deny
.Em UPDATES
based on
.Em prefix
or
.Em AS path attributes .
In addition,
.Em UPDATES
may also be modified by filter rules.
.Pp
For each
.Em UPDATE
processed by the filter, the filter rules are evaluated in sequential order,
from first to last.
The last matching
.Ic allow
or
.Ic deny
rule decides what action is taken.
.Pp
The following actions can be used in the filter:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ic allow
The
.Em UPDATE
is passed.
.It Ic deny
The
.Em UPDATE
is blocked.
.It Ic match
Apply the filter attribute set without influencing the filter decision.
.El
.Sh PARAMETERS
The rule parameters specify the
.Em UPDATES
to which a rule applies.
An
.Em UPDATE
always comes from, or goes to, one neighbor.
Most parameters are optional.
If a parameter is specified, the rule only applies to packets with
matching attributes.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic any
.It Ar address
.It Ic group Ar description
This rule applies only to
.Em UPDATES
coming from, or going to, this particular neighbor.
Neighbors can be matched against their address, the group description,
or the token
.Ic any
can be used to match any neighbor.
.Pp
.It Ar as-type as-number
This rule applies only to
.Em UPDATES
where the
.Em AS path
matches.
The
.Ar as-number
is matched against a part of the
.Em AS path
specified by the
.Ar as-type .
.Ar as-type
is one of the following operators:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width transmit-AS -compact
.It Ic AS
(any part)
.It Ic source-AS
(rightmost AS number)
.It Ic transit-AS
(all but the rightmost AS number)
.El
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic community
.Ar as-number Ns Li \&: Ns Ar local
.Xc
.It Ic community Ar name
This rule applies only to
.Em UPDATES
where the
.Ic community
path attribute is present and matches.
Both
.Ar as-number
and
.Ar local
may be set to
.Sq *
to do wildcard matching.
Alternatively, well-known communities may be given by name instead and
include
.Cm NO_EXPORT ,
.Cm NO_ADVERTISE ,
and
.Cm NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED .
.Pp
.It Ic from
.It Ic to
This rule applies to incoming or outgoing
.Em UPDATES .
Either one or the other must be specified.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic prefix
.Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar len
.Xc
This rule applies only to
.Em UPDATES
for the specified prefix.
.Pp
.It Ic prefixlen Ar range
This rule applies only to
.Em UPDATES
for prefixes where the prefixlen matches.
Prefix length ranges are specified by using these operators:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
=	(equal)
!=	(unequal)
<	(less than)
<=	(less than or equal)
>	(greater than)
>=	(greater than or equal)
-	(range including boundaries)
><	(except range)
.Ed
.Pp
>< and -
are binary operators (they take two arguments).
For instance, to match all prefix lengths >= 8 and <= 12, and hence the
CIDR netmasks 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefixlen 8-12
.Ed
.Pp
Or, to match all prefix lengths < 8 or > 12, and hence the CIDR netmasks
0\-7 and 13\-32:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefixlen 8><12
.Ed
.Pp
.Ic prefixlen
can be used together with
.Ic prefix .
.Pp
This will match all prefixes in the 10.0.0.0/8 netblock with netmasks longer
than 16:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefix 10.0.0.0/8 prefixlen > 16
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic quick
If an
.Em UPDATE
matches a rule which has the
.Ic quick
option set, this rule is considered the last matching rule, and evaluation
of subsequent rules is skipped.
.Pp
.It Ic set Ar attribute ...
All matching rules can set the
.Em AS path attributes
to some default.
The set of every matching rule is applied, not only the last matching one.
See also the following section.
.El
.Sh ATTRIBUTE SET
.Em AS path attributes
can be modified with
.Ic set .
.Pp
.Ic set
can be used on
.Ic network
statements, in
.Ic neighbor
or
.Ic group
blocks, and on filter rules.
Attribute sets can be expressed as lists.
.Pp
The following attributes can be modified:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic community
.Ar as-number Ns Li : Ns Ar local
.Xc
.It Ic community Ar name
Set the
.Em COMMUNITIES
AS path attribute.
Communities are specified as
.Ar as-number Ns Li : Ns Ar local ,
where
.Ar as-number
is an AS number and
.Ar local
is a locally-significant number between zero and
.Li 0xffff .
Alternately, well-known communities may be specified by name:
.Cm NO_EXPORT ,
.Cm NO_ADVERTISE ,
or
.Cm NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED .
.Pp
.It Ic localpref Ar number
Set the
.Em LOCAL_PREF
AS path attribute.
.Pp
.It Ic med Ar number
Set the
.Em MULTI_EXIT_DISC
AS path attribute.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic nexthop
.Po Ar address Ns \&| Ns
.Ic blackhole Ns \&| Ns Ic reject Pc
.Xc
Set the
.Em NEXTHOP
AS path attribute
to a different nexthop address, or use blackhole or reject routes.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set nexthop 192.168.0.1
set nexthop blackhole
set nexthop reject
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic pftable Ar table
Add the prefix in the update to the specified
.Xr pf 4
radix table, regardless of whether or not the path was selected for routing.
This option may be useful in building realtime blacklists.
