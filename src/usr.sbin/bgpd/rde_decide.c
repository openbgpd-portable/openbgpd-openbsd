/*
 * Decision Engine RFC implementation:
 *  Phase 1:
 *   - calculate LOCAL_PREF if needed -- EBGP or IGP learnt routes
 *   - IBGP routes may either use LOCAL_PREF or the local system computes
 *     the degree of preference
 *   - If the route is ineligible, the route MAY NOT serve as an input to
 *     the next phase of route selection
 *   - if the route is eligible the computed value MUST be used as the
 *     LOCAL_PREF value in any IBGP readvertisement
 *
 *  Phase 2:
 *   - If the NEXT_HOP attribute of a BGP route depicts an address that is
 *     not resolvable the BGP route MUST be excluded from the Phase 2 decision
 *     function.
 *   - If the AS_PATH attribute of a BGP route contains an AS loop, the BGP
 *     route should be excluded from the Phase 2 decision function.
 *   - The local BGP speaker identifies the route that has:
 *     a) the highest degree of preference of any route to the same set
 *        of destinations
 *     b) is the only route to that destination
 *     c) is selected as a result of the Phase 2 tie breaking rules
 *   - The local speaker MUST determine the immediate next-hop address from
 *     the NEXT_HOP attribute of the selected route.
 *   - If either the immediate next hop or the IGP cost to the NEXT_HOP changes,
 *     Phase 2 Route Selection MUST be performed again.
 *
 *  Route Resolvability Condition
 *   - A route Rte1, referencing only the intermediate network address, is
 *     considered resolvable if the Routing Table contains at least one
 *     resolvable route Rte2 that matches Rte1's intermediate network address
 *     and is not recursively resolved through Rte1.
 *   - Routes referencing interfaces are considered resolvable if the state of
 *     the referenced interface is up and IP processing is enabled.
 *
 *  Breaking Ties (Phase 2)
 *   1. Remove from consideration all routes which are not tied for having the
 *      smallest number of AS numbers present in their AS_PATH attributes.
 *      Note, that when counting this number, an AS_SET counts as 1
 *   2. Remove from consideration all routes which are not tied for having the
 *      lowest Origin number in their Origin attribute.
 *   3. Remove from consideration routes with less-preferred MULTI_EXIT_DISC
 *      attributes. MULTI_EXIT_DISC is only comparable between routes learned
 *      from the same neighboring AS.
 *   4. If at least one of the candidate routes was received via EBGP,
 *      remove from consideration all routes which were received via IBGP.
 *   5. Remove from consideration any routes with less-preferred interior cost.
 *      If the NEXT_HOP hop for a route is reachable, but no cost can be
 *      determined, then this step should be skipped.
 *   6. Remove from consideration all routes other than the route that was
 *      advertised by the BGP speaker whose BGP Identifier has the lowest value.
 *   7. Prefer the route received from the lowest peer address.
 *
 * Phase 3: Route Dissemination
 *   - All routes in the Loc-RIB are processed into Adj-RIBs-Out according
 *     to configured policy. A route SHALL NOT be installed in the Adj-Rib-Out
 *     unless the destination and NEXT_HOP described by this route may be
 *     forwarded appropriately by the Routing Table.
 */

/*
 * Decision Engine OUR implementation:
 * Our implementation has only one RIB. The filtering is done first. The
 * filtering calculates the preference and stores it in LOCAL_PREF (Phase 1).
 * Ineligible routes are flagged as ineligible via nexthop_add().
 * Phase 3 is done together with Phase 2.
 * In following cases a prefix needs to be reevaluated:
 *  - update of a prefix (path_update)
 *  - withdraw of a prefix (prefix_remove)
 *  - state change of the nexthop (nexthop-{in}validate)
 *  - state change of session (session down)
 *
