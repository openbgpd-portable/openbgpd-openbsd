.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <netdb.h>
.Ft "char *"
.Fn gai_strerror "int ecode"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
To aid applications in printing error messages based on the
.Dv EAI_xxx
codes returned by
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
and
.Xr getnameinfo 3 ,
.Fn gai_strerror
is defined.
The argument is one of the
.Dv EAI_xxx
values detailed below
and the return value points to a string describing the error.
If the argument is not one of the
.Dv EAI_xxx
values,
the function still returns a pointer to a string whose contents
indicate an unknown error.
.Pp
The error return status from
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
and
.Xr getnameinfo 3
is zero on success and non-zero on errors.
Non-zero error codes are defined in
.Aq Pa netdb.h ,
and are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "EAI_ADDRFAMILYXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Dv EAI_ADDRFAMILY
Address family for
.Fa nodename
not supported.
.It Dv EAI_AGAIN
Temporary failure in name resolution.
.It Dv EAI_BADFLAGS
Invalid value for
.Fa ai_flags .
.It Dv EAI_BADHINTS
Invalid value for hints.
.It Dv EAI_FAIL
