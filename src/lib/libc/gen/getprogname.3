.Dt GETPROGNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getprogname ,
.Nm setprogname
.Nd get/set the name of the current program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn getprogname "void"
.Ft void
.Fn setprogname "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These utility functions get and set the current program's name
as used by various error-reporting functions.
.Pp
.Fn getprogname
returns the name of the current program.
This function is typically useful when generating error messages
or other diagnostic output.
If the program name has not been set,
.Fn getprogname
will return
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Fn setprogname
function sets the name of the program to be the last component of the
.Fa progname
argument.
Since a pointer to the given string is kept as the program name,
it should not be modified for the rest of the program's lifetime.
.Pp
In
.Ox ,
the name of the program is set by the start-up code that is run before
.Fn main ;
thus,
running
.Fn setprogname
is not necessary.
Programs that desire maximum portability should still call it;
on another operating system,
these functions may be implemented in a portability library.
Calling
.Fn setprogname
allows the aforementioned library to learn the program name without
modifications to the start-up code.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr err 3 ,
.Xr setproctitle 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm getprogname
and
.Nm setprogname
function calls appeared in
.Ox 5.4 .
.Sh CAVEAT
The string returned by
.Fn getprogname
is supplied by the invoking process and should not be trusted by
setuid or setgid programs.
